#Fiction Rails

This is a work in progress, being used for me to practice rails skills I do not use in my job everyday. Currently implementing Angular2


### To Work in Development
1. git clone it down
1. bundle
1. rails s
1. In new tab, run tsc -w for typescript compile to watch for changes and auto compile
